I am currently a **Postdoctoral Research Fellow** at the [Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI)](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/lsgi/), **The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU)**.

My research focuses on **Geodesy and Surveying Engineering**, with a particular interest in measurement data processing theory and hydro/polar remote sensing. I have extensive experience in handling multi-source geodetic data (GNSS, InSAR, Satellite Altimetry, Satellite Gravity) to solve complex geophysical problems.

Prior to my current role, I received my Ph.D. degree from **Tongji University** and visited the **University of Stuttgart** as a joint Ph.D. student. I also have industrial experience as a Senior GNSS Algorithm Engineer.

### 🔬 Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of **theoretical data processing** and **geophysical applications**:

**1. Measurement Data Processing Theory**
* **Time Series Analysis:** Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA), PCA, Fourier Analysis, and Wavelet Analysis for spatiotemporal filtering.
* **Inverse Theory:** Regularized inversion algorithms for ill-posed models (applied to both quantitative remote sensing and geodetic inversion).
* **Statistical Estimation:** Variance Component Estimation (VCE) for multi-source data fusion.

**2. Hydro/Polar Remote Sensing & Analysis**
* **Terrestrial Water Storage:** Inversion of storage changes in typical regions and driver analysis.
* **Cryosphere Science:** Mountain glacier mass balance inversion and sea-level rise attribution.
* **Multi-source Fusion:** Joint inversion using GNSS, InSAR, Satellite Altimetry, and Satellite Gravity (GRACE/GRACE-FO).
