I am currently a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at the Department of Land Surveying and Geo-Informatics (LSGI), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University (PolyU).

My research lies at the intersection of Geodesy and Remote Sensing, focusing on theoretical innovations in data processing and their applications in hydro/polar geophysics. I have extensive experience in fusing multi-source data (GNSS, InSAR, Satellite Altimetry, GRACE/GRACE-FO).

You can find my full publication list on Google Scholar and ResearchGate.

## Research Interests

My research sits at the intersection of theoretical data processing and geophysical applications:

* **Measurement Data Processing Theory**: Time Series Analysis (SSA, PCA, Fourier/Wavelet), Inverse Theory (Regularized inversion), and Statistical Estimation (Variance Component Estimation).
* **Hydro/Polar Remote Sensing & Analysis**: Terrestrial Water Storage inversion, Glacier mass balance & sea-level rise attribution, and Multi-source Fusion (GNSS, InSAR, Altimetry, Gravity).
